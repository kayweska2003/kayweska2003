# ⚡ Kairab Gersain — Code, Fire & Relentless Drive ⚡

Hey there! I'm Kairab — a **Computer Intelligence Engineering** student at the **University of Colima**, and I'm not here to play it safe. I'm here to break patterns, write code that slaps, and build ideas that **actually mean something**.

### 🚀 What am I up to?
- 🔥 Taking the **JavaScript course by Fireship** — where the content is fast, sharp, and hot enough to burn.
- 🧠 Deep-diving into AI, computer vision, game theory, and intelligent systems.
- ⚔️ Gearing up for fullstack battle — one deploy at a time.

### 🧩 My favorite tools:
- JavaScript / Node.js
- Python
- React / Next.js
- Git & GitHub
- Vite / Vitest
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Tailwind
- MongoDB / Firebase

### 🧪 Projects in progress:
- 🛠️ **Dream App** — A project blending frontend, REST APIs, and a whole lot of visual sorcery.
- 🧠 **AI personal experiments** — Mixing theory, curiosity, and code to create stuff that borders on wizardry.

### 🌌 Why do I do this?
Because I’ve got a vision: **use technology to reshape my world and elevate others along the way**. This isn’t a random journey — it’s a mission. Between wild ideas, sleepless nights, and failing forward, I’m building something far beyond code.

> _"If you're going to do something, make it legendary."_ — Me, writing this README at 3 AM.
